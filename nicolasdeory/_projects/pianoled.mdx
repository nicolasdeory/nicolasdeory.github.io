Food Scheduler was a group project made for a web information systems class at the University of Seville.
The goal behind this project was to get a basic understanding of **PHP** and **Oracle PL/SQL**.

Oracle 11g was used as the database server, and interaction with the data layer was implemented through PL/SQL procedures.
This allowed us to separate the PHP code from the repository and business logic, as well as easily set up cronjobs which were essential
for a schedule management app.

The web app allows tracking ingredients in the user's fridge, and keeping a schedule of meals, notifying the user if they are missing ingredients.
It also provides a recipe browser, where other users can submit their recipes, as well as their ingredient amounts.

The backend also exposes a RESTful API, which makes it fairly easy to integrate with other services.
