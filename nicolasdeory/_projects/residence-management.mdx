![Residence management view](/projects/residencemanagement2.png)

[Magnolia Tree House](https://magnoliatreehouse.com/) is a student residence network mainly operating in Seville.
They needed to streamline their booking management and, while there are many existing solutions, most of them are not very
usable, having bugs or simply being very unintuitive to use.

The idea for this project was to take into account the specific needs of this residence network, while also
scaling it and building a SaaS out of it. Because every residence has different needs, this piece of software
is tailored to the requirements of every client, while always having a clean, easy-to-use interface that can
be used from any kind of device: tablet, mobile or desktop.

## Technologies used

The project was initially designed in Javascript and JQuery, but was later rewritten in **React** and **Next.js**, following
good design practices to dramatically improve maintainability. **Chakra UI** is used as the UI framework.

The backend was implemented using **Node.js** and **Express**. The frontend is served by **Netlify**, while the backend
is currently hosted in **AWS**, using **DynamoDB** as the database.

The code is currently privately hosted on GitLab, and uses **GitLab CI** to automate the deployment to AWS and Netlify.

## Keeping the codebase maintainable as the project grows

As always, maintainability is a priority. It's important to make use of React functional components to create
easy-to-test pieces that can be reused across the code. 

For example, this is the code for a confirmation modal â€“
instead of creating a new component for every kind of confirmation modal, we can create a generic component that can be reused
for all kinds of modals. This also makes it easier to test individual components.

<DemoConfirmationModal />

```tsx

export interface GenericConfirmationModalProps {
  /**
   * Whether the modal is open or not
   */
  isOpen: boolean;
  /**
   * Callback when the modal is closed
   */
  onClose: () => void;
  /**
   * Callback when the modal is accepted
   */
  onAccept: () => void;
  /**
   * Whether the modal should show a loading indicator
   */
  isLoading?: boolean;
  /**
   * Title of the modal
   */
  title: string;
  /**
   * Text of the main "confirm" button
   */
  confirmButtonText?: string;
  children: React.ReactNode; 
}

export default function ConfirmationModal({
  title,
  confirmButtonText,
  children,
  isOpen,
  onClose,
  onAccept,
  isLoading,
}: GenericConfirmationModalProps) {
  const cancelRef = useRef();

  return (
    <AlertDialog
      isOpen={isOpen}
      onClose={onClose}
      leastDestructiveRef={cancelRef}
    >
      <AlertDialogOverlay>
        <AlertDialogContent>
          <AlertDialogHeader fontSize="lg" fontWeight="bold">
            {title}
          </AlertDialogHeader>
          <AlertDialogBody>{children}</AlertDialogBody>
          <AlertDialogFooter>
            <Button ref={cancelRef} onClick={onClose} size="sm">
              Cancelar
            </Button>
            <Button
              variant="red"
              size="sm"
              onClick={onAccept}
              ml="5px"
              isLoading={isLoading}
            >
              {confirmButtonText??"Eliminar"}
            </Button>
          </AlertDialogFooter>
        </AlertDialogContent>
      </AlertDialogOverlay>
    </AlertDialog>
  );
}
