Game jams are a extremely fun way to learn how to deliver MVPs in a very short timeframe,
while also learning to work as a team. This was an amazing experience for me, not only because
the end result was very polished, but also because I had the chance to meet 
and get to work with new people, as well as face a whole new set of challenges.

The jam theme revolved around environmental awareness, more specifically about the huge amount
of waste that ends up in our oceans. The idea was to make a game around this premise, while also
being simple enough to be played by anyone.

## What is the game about?
The game takes inspiration from "Papers, Please". The player is a customs officer in the ocean,
and has to check if the different fish characters are legally allowed to enter the region.

The fish might be trying to smuggle plastic inside their bodies, so the player is given an X-ray magnifier
to analyze them. However, the rules get progressively more complicated, with rules such as the following:

- *Deny anyone coming from the **Red Sea**.*
- *If the fish has **red plastic** inside them and is wearing a **black hat**, let them pass.*
- *Otherwise, deny entry to fish having **plastic** inside them.*

The player gets a point every time they either approve or deny a fish, but get a penalty if their veredict is wrong.

## Technologies used across the team
We were two programmers in the team, and we used **Unity** as our game engine.
The other three members used **Aseprite** to design sprites and other artwork.

We ran into different challenges because of the tight time constraints, so we came up with
interesting solutions such as **dynamic character generation**, or **dynamic rules**, to make the game
more replayable without feeling dull. Thanks to the artists, we also had a lot of designs at our disposal to make
the characters less repetitive. 

Lastly, I also took on the responsibility of composing the game soundtrack and sound effects.

## Bottom line
We were extremely thrilled to be awarded "Best game" out of the other teams, but the best
memory was definitely getting to meet a ton of people coming from different backgrounds, not just programming.
