Many RGB lighting integrations for games are already available, but the main goal of this project is improve the
usability and ease of use for users, as well as make it available for as many devices as possible.

Extensibility and modularity remain a priority; the idea is to design a layer that abstracts away the vendor-specific
interfaces for lighting devices, as well as provide some common utils to create new modules from scratch in hours, rather than days.

This is what an example module looks like:
```csharp
// We extend the class LEDModule to create a new module
public class BlinkWhiteModule : LEDModule
    {
        CancellationTokenSource masterCancelToken = new CancellationTokenSource();

        // Useful module to display common effects
        AnimationModule animation = AnimationModule.Create();

        public event LEDModule.FrameReadyHandler NewFrameReady;

        public static LEDModule Create()
        {
            return new BlinkWhiteModule();
        }

        private BlinkWhiteModule()
        {
            animation.NewFrameReady += FrameReceived;
            Task.Run(() => Blinker(500)).CatchExceptions();
        }

        // Bubble up the lighting event to the main frame queue to be processed by FirelightCore
        private void FrameReceived(LEDFrame frame)
        {
            NewFrameReady.Invoke(frame);
        }

        // Basic blinking effect every 500ms. It's run in another thread.
        public async Task Blinker(int intervalMS)
        {
            bool on = false;
            while (true)
            {
                if (masterCancelToken.IsCancellationRequested)
                    return;
                if (on)
                {
                    animation.HoldColor(HSVColor.Black, LightZone.All, 0.5f, true);
                    on = false;
                }
                else
                {
                    animation.HoldColor(new HSVColor(0.2f, 1f, 1f), LightZone.All, 0.5f, true);
                    on = true;
                }
                await Task.Delay(intervalMS);
            }
        }

        // Stop the blinker in case this module is no longer being used by the user
        public void Dispose()
        {
            masterCancelToken.Cancel();
        }
    }
```

The full API is still under construction so it's still subject to change, but the snippet above showcases the general idea.
Because there is a very wide range of lighting devices in the market, instead of trying to support each of them invidiually,
devices are classified into categories or **light zones**:

```csharp
public enum LightZone
    {
        None = 0,
        Keyboard = 1, 
        Strip = 2, 
        Mouse = 4, 
        Mousepad = 8, 
        Headset = 16, 
        Keypad = 32, 
        General = 64,
        All = Keyboard | Strip | Mouse | Mousepad | Headset | Keypad | General,
        Desk = Keyboard | Mouse | Mousepad | Keypad,
        MouseKey = Keyboard | Mouse
    }
```

Each light zone contains a certain number of LEDs. For example, the **Keyboard** zone contains 109 LEDs, which
is generally what regular RGB keyboards have, more or less. The **General** zone contains 5 LEDs, which allows
addressing devices that don't fall into any ohe other categories, such as gaming chairs, PC cases, or monitors.

This architecture allows creating integrations for games in a very modular way:

Lastly, there's a user interface that lets the user customize miscellaneous options, ranging from **game-specific settings**
to **lighting effect customization** (i.e. what color the health bar should have, don't light up specific devices, etc.):

I was also extremely humbled to have the support of peripheral manufacturer **Razer** very early into the project, 
sending a wide array of hardware to test effects with.
I was also very happy and grateful to have the chance to showcase some of the game integrations in Razer DevCon 2021.
