Plan your household meals. With Semana, you can create weekly meal menus for your family â€“ keep them synced across all your devices and share them with your spouse, children or roommates.

# KEEP YOUR MEALS ORGANIZED:

## YOUR WEEKLY MEALS IN ONE PLACE
Always keep a bird's eye view on your meal plan. Move to any week in the year and change the plan at any time.
Thanks to AI, you can import any meal menus you have already made and bring them to the app seamlessly. It's easy to eat balanced when it's so simple to stay organized!

## FLEXIBLE MEAL PLANNER
Add all your household members and make individual plans for each person. Is your kid having lunch at school? Bring his school menu so you can keep track of what their lunch is. A great way to simplify planning a good dinner for them that evening!
If your spouse or roommate has a different diet or meal plan, you can easily keep them separate, while still being able to view them at a glance. You'll be able to see what is each person eating for each day of the month.

## INVITE YOUR ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD
You can add your significant other, children or roommates to the app, so that anyone can easily see what everyone else is eating, and can easily change the menu if there is any change of plans.

## SAVE ALL YOUR RECIPES
Save your recipes and add them to your daily meal plan. You can attach a picture and assign categories to recipes to keep them organized and find them in a flash. And if you add ingredients to a recipe, you will get automatic recommendations to add them to your shopping list if they are not stocked in your pantry!

## SIMPLY POWERFUL SHOPPING LIST
A shopping list should not pretend to be something it's not. So you can see the household's shopping list directly in the app and add and remove ingredients super easily. Nothing more than that. But it's smart enough to recommend you to add items you frequently use, and also ingredients you will need to cook the meals you have planned for the next month! This is particularly useful if you do your shopping once a month and want to make sure you don't forget to add anything to your list.

## KEEP YOUR PANTRY ORGANIZED
Everyone's fridge can get a bit crazy from time to time. Sometimes it's hard to remember when is some sauce or leftover food expiring in your fridge, freezer or pantry. Instead of relying on post-it notes or having to look for the expiration label, you can just add your ingredients to the app and receive an automatic notification when the item is about to expire. Great to reduce the amount of food thrown away. If some ingredients are expiring, it's a good opportunity to cook a meal with those items before it's too late!

## AI THAT HELPS YOU SAVE TIME
We believe that AI can be a great copilot in life. We are constantly adding new AI-assisted features that we think are going to help you save lots of time in your daily tasks. You can import any menus you have previously made (even in handwriting!) and we will assign them to the correct days of the month.
The automatic shopping recommendations are also a great starting point for your shopping list. Based on the recipes you planned in a month, we will recommend you to check if you have the necessary ingredients stocked. And if not, you can add them to your list in a single tap.
